# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data about UCI bank marketing, we will be doing classfication to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit with the bank. First, we will create and optimize an Scikit Logistic Regression ML pipeline, the hyperparamaters of which we will optimize using Hyperdrive. Then we will be comparing with the Auto ML results. 

In our experiment, the best performing model is stackensembleclassifier generated by AutoML.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
1. First we need to get our 'workspace'  and 'experiment' objects running. Then a compute cluster is created to run the experiment with compute configuration 'vm_size' :'Standard_D2_V2' and 'max_nodes=4'.
2. Conda_dependencies.yml file is created for creating Sckit-learn environment.

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
